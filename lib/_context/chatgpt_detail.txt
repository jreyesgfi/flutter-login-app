Hi! today I have some fancy gym exercise register coded in fluter i provide you the files, so the user access to the main_screen, login with aws (which is developed with amplify) and can save new entries as well as capture the previous ones.
There is a ExerciseCard component which define the logic of how to display each field in the cards of both saved entries and the new one.
Also there is a MuscleDateSelector component to select both a muscle and a date and its info is shared with the Exercise Card through a provider. 
In this component we can search for the selection (date and muscle) and we retrieve all the exercises within the selected date and the previous session to the date selected.

There are a few features I want to add.
